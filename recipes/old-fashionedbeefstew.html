    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A hearty warmth-filled meal with lean beef chunks. Perfect for a cozy night in. </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound of lean beef, cut into 1 inch cubes</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons of flour</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons of vegetable oil</li>
        <li>2 thinly sliced onions</li>
        <li>2 cups of fresh sliced mushrooms</li>
        <li>2 cloves of garlic, minced</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons of tomato paste</li>
        <li>2 cups of beef broth</li>
        <li>4 cups of sliced carrots</li>
        <li>2 potatoes, sliced into 1/4 inch slices</li>
        <li>1 cup of fresh chopped green beans</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon of cornstarch</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon of cold water</li>
        <li>1/4 cup of chopped parsley</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Coat your beef cubes with flour, and shake off the excess. In a large nonstick stock pot, heat oil over medium to high heat. Saute the beef for at least 6 minutes or until they brown. Then remove beef from the stock pot and set aside.</li>
        <li>Add onions and mushrooms to the stock pot and saute for 6 minutes. Add your garlic and saute for 1 minute while continually stirring.</li>
        <li>Clean out the stock pot and then re-add your beef cubes to the pot along with your tomato paste and broth. Add enough water to just cover ingredients and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and let it simmer until beef is tender, for about 1 hour and 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Skim off any foam that has accumulated on the surface of stew and add your carrots, potatoes and green beans. Partially cover the pot and let it simmer for 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>In a small mixing bowl, mix cornstarch and cold water. Pour the mixture into the stew and stir. Increase heat and boil leaving pot uncovered for 1 minute. Sprinkle with parsley and serve.</li>
    </ol>
