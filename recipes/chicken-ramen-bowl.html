        <li>1/2 cup of reduced-sodium soy sauce</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons of mirin</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon of fish sauce</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon of sriracha sauce</li>
        <li>4 cups of low-sodium chicken broth</li>
        <li>1 cup of water</li>
        <li>3/4 pound of baby bok choy</li>
        <li>1 cooked shredded chicken breast</li>
        <li>3 (3 ounce) packages of dried ramen noodles</li>
        <li>4 eggs</li>
        <li>2 chopped green onions</li>
        <li>1/4 cup of chopped cilantro</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat 1 tablespoon of your vegetable oil in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add your onion and saute for about 5 minutes. Add your garlic and ginger; cook for about 30 seconds more. Next add your rice vinegar, soy sauce, mirin, fish sauce, and sriracha sauce. Stir. Add your chicken broth and water and bring the mixture to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for 5 minutes. Finally add in your bok choy and chicken; simmer for 2 minutes or until the bok choy is tender. Cover and keep warm.</li>
        <li>Fill another large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Add your ramen noodles and return to a boil. Stir occasionally for 5 to 7 minutes; until the noodles are tender. Drain the noodles and drizzle your remaining vegetable oil to prevent sticking.</li>
        <li>Fill another pot with enough water to cover your eggs and bring it to a boil. Gently place your eggs into the boiling water and cook for about 7 minutes.</li>
        <li>Fill a large bowl with ice water. Transfer your eggs to the ice water for about 3 minutes to halt the cooking process. Drain the eggs, carefully peel away the shells, and slice in half.</li>
        <li>Put your ramen into as many serving bowls as desired. Add your broth mixture and then top with your green onions, cilantro, and soft boiled egg halves. Serve and enjoy!</li>
